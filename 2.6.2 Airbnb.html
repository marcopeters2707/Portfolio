						<h1>Project: Airbnb</h1>
						<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Introduction</h4>
						<p>This one-pager is a personal project I made in order to learn some new functions in Power BI. The datasets I downloaded 
							from Kaggle and contain extensive data on Airbnb prices in some of the most popular cities in Europe.
							Each row in the dataset contains information about one completed overnight stay via Airbnb in 2021. The data contains
							variables such as price, location, date, whether you rent an entire apartment or a room in a shared apartment, etc.
							In addition, it contains information about the Airbnb experience, such as how satisfied the customer was with the stay and whether the landlord is a
							so-called "superhost". You can find the report below here, click on the image to test it in the Power BI app.

						<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Analysis</h4>
						<p>After processing the data in Power Query, the overall dataset contained over 50,000 registered overnight stays in 10 different cities. 
							It is important to note that this data is not necessarily representative for the Airbnb-market in any of these cities. This data is not complete enough to provide a basis for any conclusions.</p>
						<p>According to the data, Amsterdam is the most expensive city for an overnight stay through Airbnb. With an average price of 287 euros 
							per night, Amsterdam is considerably more expensive than Athens, the least expensive city with an average price of 88 euros per night. 
							More than half of all bookings were weekend-bookings, but the price level during weekends and weekdays is approximately the same. 
							One explanation may be that both supply and demand are highest during weekends. One factor that has a clear influence on price 
							is whether a listing is registered as a so-called "business listing". These listings are particularly suitable for people who use Airbnb 
							for "business", and cities with a low share of these listings tend to have higher average prices. This may indicate that prices are 
							pushed up by non-business related overnight stays. Other price-driving factors are whether a listing is located near the city centre or 
							a metro station.</p>
						<p>As a mini-case, I combined this dataset with a dataset on prices of sold apartments in Amsterdam during the same period. As both 
							data sets contained coordinates and price, I compared different areas of the city to see if housing prices and prices of Airbnb 
							listings were correlated. The least expensive Amsterdam neighborhood on Airbnb was "Zuidoost" with an average nightly price of 
							167 euros. The most expensive neighbourhood was, unsurprisingly perhaps, the city centre, with an average of â‚¬355 per night. 
							This price difference is also reflected in the price difference of sold apartments in these two areas. Square meter prices in 
							the city center were also on average over 100% higher than in "Zuidoost". In the "Noord" district, a large share of Airbnb-listings 
							were "business listings" and were conducted during weekdays. This indicates that this is an area that is often visited by people 
							that are in Amsterdam for "business". In this district, both housing prices and prices of Airbnb-listings are considerably lower 
							than in the city centre. This again indicates that it is not business, but most likely tourism that drives up prices in a city like Amsterdam.</p>
