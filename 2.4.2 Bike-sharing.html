							<h1>Bike-sharing</h1>
							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Introduction</h2>
							<p>As part of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I did an analysis of Cyclistic, a fictional company that rents 
								out city bikes in Chicago. Cyclistic users are offered both single tickets, day passes and annual memberships. The management 
								at Cyclistic wants to convert more users from using single tickets and day passes to annual memberships, and therefore wants 
								to map user behaviour. My task was therefore to create a report containing a description of the business task, which data 
								is used, documentation of all data processing and a full analysis with visualisations, key findings and recommendations.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> In this context, I have chosen to divide the customer group into two. The first group consists of customers who have 
									previously bought single tickets or day passes. I have chosen to call this group "casual users" or casuals. The second 
									group consists of "members", and consists of those who have made bought an annual membership. The business task is thus 
									to understand in which ways these two customer groups use Cyclistic in order to map how casual users can be turned into 
									members. </p>
									<p></p>
									
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Data sources and data processing</h2>
								<p>The dataset consists of user data from January to December 2021, where each observation is one trip completed by a 
									Cyclistic user. Each data set is in csv format and I have used SQL / Google Big Query to process and analyze the data 
									and Power BI to visualize the result. There are some limitations in the data that we should be aware of. "Classic bikes" 
									or "docked bikes" refer to the same type of bike. All "docked bikes" are replaced by "classic bikes using REPLACE. 
									Classic bikes are always collected and delivered at a bike station. Electric bikes however, have a bike lock, which 
									allows users to park them anywhere near a bike station. I therefore remove observations for classic bikes that lack a 
									start and end station, while for electric bikes I simply replace empty values with "bike lock". I consider all 
									observations that are shorter than one minute or longer than one day not to be relevant customer data and are 
									therefore removed. These can be incorrect registrations, tests carried out by Cyclistic or bikes that have been stolen. </p>
									<img src="images/cyclistic_columns.jpg" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
								<p>The data set consists of 5 595 063 rows, which means that almost 5.6 million trips were registered through Cyclistic 
									in 2021. The data set is uploaded in Biq Query and consists of the following columns:</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">1. <b>Ride_id</b> is a primary key with unique values.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">2. <b>Rideable_type</b> now consists of two different types of bikes: the classic bike and the electric bike.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">3. <b>Started_at</b> and <b>ended_at</b> refer to the date and time a trip started / ended.</p>	
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">4. <b>Start_station_name</b> and <b>end_station_name</b> are names of stations. </p>	
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">5. <b>I consider Start_station_id</b> and <b>end_station_id</b> as irrelevant for this analysis.</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">6. <b>Start_lat</b>, <b>start_lng</b>, <b>end_lat</b> and <b>end_lng</b> refer to the coordinates of the start and end points.</p>	
								<p >   						   7. <b>Member_casual</b> indicates wether a trip was conducted by a member or a casual user.</p>
								<p>Using TIMESTAMP_DIFF I also add a column with the length of the trip in minutes.</p>
								
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Analysis and visualization</h2>
								<p>To answer the business task, we should focus on any differences between the two user groups. As we have time series data, 
									it can be interesting to look at when users use Cyclistic during the day, the week or the year. Therefore, I include a 
									date, day, and time column in my query, as well as a "season" column. The entire query I uploaded to Power BI contained 
									34,000 rows and looked like this:</p>
									<img src="images/cyclistic_full_query.jpg" style="float: left; width: 90%; margin-right: 9%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
								<p>The report I built in Power BI is presented underneath this section. I started by looking at the most important KPIs. 
									In 2021, around 5 million trips were registered. Among these, 2.8 million were registered by members and 2.2 million 
									by casual users. One bike trip lasted on average around 17 minutes, but while members spent an average of just below 13 
									minutes on one trip, casual users spent just over 21 minutes. To see if casual users also ride longer distances, I used 
									the so-called Haversine formula (see query). This formula calculates the average distance between the start and end station, 
									which can give some indication of the distance traveled. The average distance between the start and end station on one 
									bike trip is around 2.35 kilometres, with minimal differences between user groups. Of all registered trips around a third 
									were conducted on electric bikes, which are slightly more popular among casual users.</p>
									<img src="images/cyclistic_dashboard.jpg" style="float: right; width: 60%; margin-left: 3%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
								<p>The line chart at the bottom left visualizes the number of trips per month, which shows a clear seasonal demand. Cyclistic is 
									clearly used most from June to August, especially among casual users. The pie chart in the middle of the report shows 
									that almost half (49%) of all bike trips registered by casual users were recorded during the summer months (June, July and 
									August). Among members, the number of registered trips is spread slightly more evenly throughout the year.</p>
								<p>Looking at the second pie chart and filtering for casual users, we notice that this user group uses Cyclistic mostly on 
									Saturday and Sunday. Among this user group, 41% of all cycle trips in 2021 were actually registered on Saturday or Sunday. 
									The corresponding figure among members is 26%. Among members, the service is actually used mostly from Tuesday to Friday. 
									If we filter for weekdays only and look at the line chart at the bottom right, we notice another distinct pattern. 
									Members seem to use the service mostly most during two time periods of the day: from around 07:00 to 09:00 and from 
									17:00 to 19:00. In fact, 25% of all cycling trips among members were carried out between 07.00 and 09.00. Casual users also 
									use the service most during this time period, but the pattern is not as clear.</p>
									<img src="images/cyclistic_geomap.jpg" style="float: right; width: 60%; margin-left: 3%; margin-bottom: 1em;">
								<p>Finally, let's take a look at the geodata. I plotted the 50 most popular starting and ending stations for both members 
									and casual users in four different map charts. The results are shown on the right, and if we look closely, we can see a 
									pattern here. The most popular stations among casual users are found along the coastline of Chicago, while members seem 
									to move more in what appear to be urban areas.</p>
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>Key findings</b></h2>
								<p>Although it is too early to draw conclusions, there are several indications that members and casual users use Cyclistic 
									for different purposes. <b>Members seem to use the service to get around in their daily lives, while casual users use the 
										service mostly for leisure.</b></p>
									<p>On average, casual users use more time for each bike ride, but they do not appear to travel larger distances than 
										members. This may indicate that casual users try to get the most value out of their single tickets and day passes. 
										Therefore it would be interesting to look at the prices of the various products. However, it may also indicate that
										that casual users do not go directly from A to B and are not in as much of a hurry. Furthermore, casual users 
										use Cyclistic mostly during the summer months and in weekends. They mostly seem to bike along Chicago's coastline, 
										an area which is full of beaches, parks and other types of leisure attractions. This may again indicate that this user 
										group uses the service to a greater extent for leisure.
								<p>Members use Cyclistic mostly during weekdays and also to a greater extent year-round. They use this service mostly 
									during rush hours, which may indicate that they use it mostly to commute to and from work. This idea is strengthened 
									by the fact that the most popular stations among members are located in urban areas. However, we must keep in mind 
									that this is aggregated data where one single user can register many bike rides. The data therefore does not show
									how an average member or an average casual user uses Cyclistic.</p>
								<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Recommendations</h2>
								<p>If we remind ourselves of the business task, namely to map how casual users can be turned into members, then there are 
									several ways forward. A good way to start is to do an even more thorough analysis. We should collect demographic and 
									qualitative data (about user motivations, routines etc.) to find out for what purpose a user uses Cyclistic, what is 
									important to this user and what he/she is willing to pay for the service. Demographic data such as income, address, 
									age and BMI are also highly relevant. Through a user survey for instance, we may also test the hypothesis that members 
									use the service to a large extent for communting in their daily lives, while casual users use it mostly for leisure.
									This may help us uncover major opportunities or obstacles for turning casual users into members. It may for instance 
									uncover that many are only on vacation or a weekend trip to Chicago, and therefore do not choose an annual membership.</p>
								<p>More analysis takes up time and resources before any measures can be initiated, but it will give us a more thorough 
									understanding of the situation. In addition, a benefit-cost analysis should be carried out regardless of which measures 
									are being assessed to see if a certain measure will pay off. Changes can be expensive, and an increase in the number of 
									memberships will possibly also increase costs. </p>
								<p>We can however already think of some further measures that may affect various random users. Introducing holiday passes or 
									weekend passes that only grant access to Cyclistic during holidays or weekends are examples of this. If further analysis 
									shows that many casual users actually live in Chicago but lack motivation, Cyclistic can be marketed as a reasonable, 
									healthy and climate-friendly alternative to using a car. Another measure could be a pricing model where a membership gives 
									certain privileges, like being able to reserve a bike during rush hour. This will add increased predictability for those 
									who may wish to use the service to and from work.
